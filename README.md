# Organizations (User Friendly Headless CMS)

## Why another CMS?

The CMS systems around the world are doing great job for different users, but what if there is a much simpler, easier to use and configure CMS for you, so that you get you App/MVP to the users ASAP. that's what Organizations CMS does it remove all complex layers of interactions and provides an intuitive interface to work with.

## Goals

The biggest goal for any CMS is to be able to get along with any kind of frontend. Organizations keeps the same goal and hopes to provide a platform to frontend developer and designers to easily get started with thier ideas.

## Scallability?

As we all know that at time when applications grow people just want to move towards cloud like AWS or any other cloud where they want to have a separate database and a backend for ther product, that's why we are working on a feature to export all the data and processes in a standard format so, at any stage of your product's lifecycle you can move away from the CMS gracefully.
